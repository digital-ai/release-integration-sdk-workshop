# Lab 6 - Clean

Now we will learn how to clean the cluster from our installation of the Digital.ai Deploy.

Run following to clean the cluster from the installed resources:

```shell
xl kube clean
```

Note that in case if you are sharing cluster with others, do not delete the CR that is shared between all installations.
So you need to answer to `Should CRD be reused, if No we will delete the CRD digitalaideploys.xld.digital.ai, and all related CRs will be deleted with it:` with `Yes`.

With following example we are deleting installed resources along with PVC, only CRD remains on the cluster (example on the Azure):

```text
$ xl kube clean
? Following kubectl context will be used during execution: `azure-aks-test-cluster`? Yes
? Select the Kubernetes setup where the Digital.ai Devops Platform will be installed, updated or cleaned: AzureAKS [Azure AKS]
? Do you want to use an custom Kubernetes namespace (current default is 'digitalai'): Yes
? Enter the name of the Kubernetes namespace where the Digital.ai DevOps Platform will be installed, updated or cleaned: ns-yourname
? Product server you want to perform clean for: dai-deploy [Digital.ai Deploy]
? Enter the name of custom resource definition you want to reuse or replace: digitalaideploys.xld.digital.ai
? Should CRD be reused, if No we will delete the CRD digitalaideploys.xld.digital.ai, and all related CRs will be deleted with it: Yes
? Enter the name of custom resource: dai-xld-ns-yourname
? Should we preserve persisted volume claims? If not all volume data will be lost: No

The clean process is cleaning everything from the cluster. For each resource it is asking for confirmation before delete.
