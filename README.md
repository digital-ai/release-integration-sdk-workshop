![Build new integrations in an instant!](integration-sdk-logo.png)

To make your job easier, we are bringing a new integration SDK experience that gets you up and running in a matter of minutes.

Run tasks as containers, using any language or third-party library.

## SDK Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to

* Build and maintain custom integrations using Python 3
* Set up a development environment for building, testing, installing, and running integration tasks
* Configure a production-style architecture to run the container-based tasks in a Kubernetes cluster

## Prerequisites

You will run this workshop on your own machine. You will need to have the following installed

### Bare minimum

To run the HelloWorld example and do a few minor modifications to the example, you only need

* A git client
* Docker
* Admin privileges on your system

This is all to get started!

The template project to get you started provides build scripts and a development environment that will launch Digital.ai Release with a temporary license.

### Development exercises

To start developing the integrations plugins, install the following

* Python3, version 3.11
* The `pip` installer tool for Python
* A code editor or IDE like VisualCode or PyCharm

### Production setup (optional)

Container-based integration plugins are meant to run on a Kubernetes cluster. To have a hands-on experience you will need the following components.

üê≤ _**Note:**_ Some Kubernetes experience is needed to make the best of this exercise. Feel free to skip this part of Kubernetes is all new to you (or be prepared for a steep learning curve)

Refer to [Part 4](part-4/lab-6-prepare-for-kubernetes.md) for a detailed list of requirements regarding the Kubernetes setup.
